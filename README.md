I made this for a university researcher who was obsessed with medical studies!

# üîé : PDF-Founder (or Searcher) !
Well, if you want to search for a word among several PDFs at once and find the text you want, "PDF-Founder" will do it for you!

## üìå : What exactly is this?
Well, a very suitable user interface and also the ability to become a Windows installation program (.exe)!
I think it is not without grace that you can give him as many PDFs as you want, so that he can go and print the word with the line he found in it in a picture and make your reading easier!

## ‚öôÔ∏è : How do I use it?
In the first step, you must install the following libraries:

### PySimpleGUI
```python
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

### PyMuPDF
```python
pip install PyMuPDF
```

### pytesseract
```python
pip install pytesseract
```

### Pillow
```python
pip install Pillow
```

### os
```python
pip install os
```


### And you also need to install tesseract:
- [Ubuntu - tesseract-ocr-devel PPA](https://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr-devel)
- [Debian - notesalexp.org](https://notesalexp.org/tesseract-ocr/#tesseract_5.x)
- [Windows - Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)


## ‚úíÔ∏è Final word:
**Finally, I must say that e-code has an educational aspect and any misuse such as cheating in exams is the responsibility of the consumer and I have no responsibility for such things!**

And if you have any idea in any language and any programming style, you can tell me on [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/4CMqvYV2Uy) and I will implement it for you!
